We address this by:\n\n1. **Combining features strategically** - Using weighted combinations that capture upside potential\n2. **Using remaining sums, not individual forecasts** - Individual forecasts are too close to actual (causes bias)\n3. **Trend-based committed ratio** - Ratio increases Jan→Dec, simulate with random % increase\n4. **Recursive lag features** - Prediction becomes lag_1 for next month\n5. **Using 3-month prediction average** - For features requiring smoothed inputs\n\n## 15 SELECTED FEATURES WITH REASONING\n\nEach feature is selected based on:\n- Business intuition (explainable to stakeholders)\n- Predictive power (correlation + mutual information)\n- Stability (minimal imputation needed for simulation)\n- Addressing under-prediction (upside capture)"]
